System Architecture and Technologies Used

Our system follows a three-tier architecture consisting of:

Frontend (Client Side)

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structure, styling, and interactivity.

Uses Bootstrap for responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.

Provides features like browsing cakes, placing orders, and interacting with the UI.

Backend (Server Side)

Developed with Node.js and Express.js to handle requests, routes, and business logic.

Manages user authentication, order processing, and communication between the client and database.

Implements Bcrypt for secure password encryption and Passport.js for authentication.

Database Layer

Uses PostgreSQL as the main relational database.

Stores user information, cakes, orders, likes, and admin data.

Provides efficient data retrieval for browsing and managing orders.

Additional Technologies

Git & GitHub for version control.

GCash Integration (planned) for online payments.

This architecture ensures the system is modular, secure, and scalable, allowing easy updates in both the frontend and backend while maintaining a reliable data flow.
